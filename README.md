# 255 Shades of Gray (Pun intented)
 <br/>
 This program started as silly application, but latere I kept adding more stuff to It, and eventually became an experimentation playground. It encompases several functionalities ranging from small physics application (throwing a ball in a controled environment and adjusting the parameters) to some CGI effects(Like in stark trek reaching warp-speed)

 # Approximation of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers
 <br/>
 As the tittle suggest it's a program that aproximates trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. I created it for an assignment in our Fuzzy Logic class.
 It also comes with a build-in co-domain viewer written from scratch.

 # Catmull-Rom Surfaces 
 <br/>
  Here I tried to model the Catmull-Rom curve function as a surface problem in order to generate different elevation layers that might be used for procedural island generation, however Noise functions still take the lead with less computational overhead and satisfying results.

 # Fractal Tree
 <br/>
 I created this program out of curiousty to better understand the concept of fractals and their use cases.

 # Maze Analize
 <br/>
 This program was inspired by the popular game "Temple Run". I wanted to see the likelyhood of the minium bounds an endless runner ends up taking in world space coordinates.(By the way this follows a uniform distribution)

 # Orbits
 <br/>
 This was made for an assignment in my first undergraduate year for some bonus point. The task was to create a reccursive solar system generator that would tell each time when 2 or more celestial objects collide.

 # Sierpinski Triangle
 <br/>
 Another small fractal project. I did this only for the purpose of generating an insteresting color palette.

 # Program_4_general_purpose
 <br/>
 A small unity project where I tried to generate some meshes from scratch and also tried to replicate Heroes of the Storm Hero Select layout.
 <br/>
 The first thing I tried to was to generate a sin wave made up of hexagon prisms generated from scratch in C# using the Unity's mesh API's.

 <br/>
 Afterwards I tried creating a Serpinski pyramid(transforming the 2d triangle intro a pyramid) from scratch using only Unity's mesh API.

 Lastly I tried to replicate the Hero Selection Menu from the game Heroes of The Storm
